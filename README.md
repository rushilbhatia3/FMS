Hello!
This is my attempt at building a file/warehouse management system. 

The first iteration worked well enough to be installed in something like a library. However, my aim is a lot bigger - something warehouse-level that can be used in corporations. 
This repo is a documentation of my current work. 

<h1>The Stable build is stored on Main </h1>
<p>
  Current working branch - new-internal-system
</p>
<span> Reason for new branch - creating a system that is more robust and aligned with the long term vision of the project</span>
<p>
  Please note that the new branches will most likely break the build - use at your own risk!
