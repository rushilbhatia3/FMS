Hello!
This is my attempt at building a file/warehouse management system. 

The first iteration worked well enough to be installed in something like a library. However, my aim is a lot bigger - something warehouse level that can be used in corporations. 
This repo is a documentation of my current work. 

#The Stable build is stored on Main 
##Current working branch - refactored_databse
