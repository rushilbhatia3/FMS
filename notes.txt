30th October
keep a note of the new helper settings in the db.py - these will have to be changed when you implemetn the rest of the settings menu 

31st October:
- we have been adding new stuff but i think there are going to be namespace issues mostly here: 
    -> between expecting Admin and User Vs. ('operator','viewer')


3rd November: 
-> tried to refactor the database and ended up breaking everything 
-> rebased main to reflect the latest change from the settings branch - must delete that branch now since everything is updated 
->
