30th October
keep a note of the new helper settings in the db.py - these will have to be changed when you implemetn the rest of the settings menu 

31st October:
- we have been adding new stuff but i think there are going to be namespace issues mostly here: 
    -> between expecting Admin and User Vs. ('operator','viewer')


3rd November: 
-> tried to refactor the database and ended up breaking everything 
-> rebased main to reflect the latest change from the settings branch - must delete that branch now since everything is updated 
-> 

6th November:
This is this wonderful thing we can do called scheduling - if we know an item is needed at say 4 Pm - we can send a reminder / prepare a briefing in the morning 
the briefing idea is lovely too - stock low? append it in the morning. Stock due for check out? Append it in the morning. 

Later this can be hooked to an automated system which can automatically reposition items for check out based on past movements. 
Past movements itself can give so much information when connected to a "users" db 
- who checks out the most items. Who has the longest checkouts - who has the longest overdues - who checks out a particular item frequentlty, 
- what items are certain items guarenteed to be checked out, etc.
